Basic Story: 
You just woke up. Shitty story, I know. You've woken up in this dungeon enterance with a broom and a dustpan. God says he wants you to clean the dungeon of filth and scum.
You trip and fall, the broom breaks in half giving you a sharp stick. "A sword and shield!" you think. How pathetic. Go clean the dungeon.
